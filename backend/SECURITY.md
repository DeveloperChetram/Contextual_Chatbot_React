# Security Guidelines for Backend API

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the backend API to prevent sensitive data exposure and maintain data integrity.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Password Hash Protection
- **Issue**: Password hashes were being exposed in API responses
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `select: false` to passwordHash field in user schema
  - Implemented explicit `.select('+passwordHash')` only when needed for authentication
  - Added `toJSON()` method to automatically remove passwordHash from serialized objects
  - Created response sanitization middleware to catch any remaining exposures

### 2. Credit Information Protection
- **Issue**: Credit information was being exposed in unwanted places
- **Solution**:
  - Modified credits controller to only return necessary credit information
  - Removed console.log statements that could expose sensitive data
  - Added proper error handling without exposing internal details

### 3. Response Sanitization Middleware
- **Purpose**: Automatically sanitize all API responses to remove sensitive data
- **Features**:
  - Removes passwordHash, password, secret, token, refreshToken fields
  - Sanitizes user, chat, and message objects
  - Handles arrays and nested objects recursively
  - Applied globally to all routes

### 4. Data Model Security
- **User Model Improvements**:
  - Added email uniqueness constraint
  - Added lowercase and trim validation for email
  - Added trim validation for name fields
  - Added minimum value constraint for credits
  - Implemented automatic passwordHash exclusion

### 5. Controller Security
- **Auth Controllers**:
  - Sanitized user responses in register and login
  - Removed passwordHash from all response objects
  - Added proper error handling

- **Chat Controllers**:
  - Sanitized chat and message responses
  - Removed any potential sensitive data exposure
  - Added proper data mapping for responses

## Security Best Practices

### DO:
- Always use `.select('+passwordHash')` when you need passwordHash for authentication
- Use the response sanitization middleware for all routes
- Validate and sanitize input data
- Use proper error handling without exposing internal details
- Log errors securely without exposing sensitive data

### DON'T:
- Never return passwordHash in API responses
- Don't log sensitive information like passwords or tokens
- Don't expose internal error details to clients
- Don't skip input validation
- Don't trust client-side data without server-side validation

## Testing Security
To verify that sensitive data is not exposed:

1. **Test Registration**: Check that passwordHash is not returned in response
2. **Test Login**: Verify only necessary user data is returned
3. **Test Credits**: Ensure only credit count is returned, not other user data
4. **Test Chat/Messages**: Verify no sensitive user data is leaked

## Future Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Add request logging for security monitoring
- Consider implementing API versioning
- Add input validation middleware
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Consider adding request size limits
